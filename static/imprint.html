<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<h2>Purpose of the web site</h2>
This web site is dedicated to non-profit research for public good. 
<h2>Contents of the web site</h2>
<p>The web site content has been compiled with due diligence. However, it neither guaranteed nor any liability accepted for the information being up-to-date, complete or accurate.</p>
<h2>Links to External Websites</h2>
<p>The web site contains links to external third-party web sites. These links to third-party sites do not imply approval of their contents. The web site has no influence on the current or future contents of these sites. We therefore accept no liability for the accessibility or contents of such websites and no liability for damages that may arise as a result of the use of such content.</p>
<h2>Data protection</h2>
<h3>Logging of retrieval/download requests</h3>
<p>Every time a user accesses the web site and every time a file is requested, data connected to these processes are stored in a log, including the IP-address of the originating request. 
<h3>Logging of authentication data for uploading and/or modifying content</h3>
When users want to register content on the web site, they have to authenticate themselves via existing third party user profiles, currently this is possible via Google, Github or LinkedIn. By relying on such external profiles, we do not have to store detailed personal information such as person names and email addresses ourselves. We have no influence on the processes involved on side of the maintainers of these services but chose popular services which we verified to contain GDPR compliancy statements:
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/compliance/#?modal_active=none">Google data protection statement</a>
<br>
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/">Github privacy statement</a>
<br>
<a href="https://privacy.linkedin.com/gdpr">LinkedIn GDPR statement</a>
<br>
<br>
The result of the authentication process via one of these Social Media profiles, however, is logged locally including the user id of that third party profile, and whenever a user stores information via the web site, his or her user id is stored alongside the content in order to identify the stored content with that user. Besides that, the sole responsibility for uploaded and registered content lies with the authenticated users uploading and registering that content.
<br>
<br>
The log is not accessible to the public and the data that is saved will be used for statistical purposes/debugging only. This information will not be disclosed to third parties.
